Write an algorithm that requests the reading of a series of individual characters
and count how many times the letter "a" is entered.
The user ends by entering the "$" symbol.

Develop an algorithm to count the number of students whose weight is between 50 and 60,
between 61 and 80 and between 81 and 100. The weights are entered by keyboard and report
the number of students in each category of weight. How does the algorithm change
if I want to accumulate weight totals for each category?

var number : count = 0
var number : n
var number : cat50to60 = 0
var number : cat61to80 = 0
var number : cat81to100 = 0
var number : catOthers = 0

		cat50to60 = cat50to60 + 1
	ELSE IF (weight > 60 AND weight <= 80) THEN
		cat61to80 = cat61to80 + 1
	ELSE IF (weight > 80 AND weight <= 100) THEN
		cat81to100 = cat81to100 + 1
	ELSE
		catOthers = catOthers + 1

Develop an algorithm to determine if a series of numbers
that the user is entering is in increasing order or not.
