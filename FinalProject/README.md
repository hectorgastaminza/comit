# ComIT FINAL PROJECT

## Sumary:
This project should be able to allow a user control or get information from remote devices. For instance get the temperature in certain place of their home, turn on/off lights, etc.
My idea is an website/application where users could see a list of their remote devices, its information such as status and location.

## The information required to store is:
- List of users, with is login information
- List of places/location where a user could have remote devices (house, work, car, living room, etc.)
- List of remote devices and its configuration data.

## Features:
"Users can log in to the website/application with their username and password, to gain access"
"Users can add new places/locations"
"Users can add new remote devices"
"Users can assign remote devices to a place"
"Users can edit the information of remote devices"
"Users can edit places"
"Users can view all the information of their places and its remote devices"
"Application have to update the information received from the remote devices"
